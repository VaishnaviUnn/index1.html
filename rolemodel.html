    <p><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b>[pron 1] (<b>2 october 1869</b>– <b>30 January 1948</b>) was an Indian lawyer,<b>anti-colonial nationalist</b> and <b>political ethicist</b> who employed <b>nonviolent resistance</b> to lead the successful <b>campaign for India's independence</b> from <b>British rule</b>. He inspired movements for <b>civil rights</b> and freedom across the world. The honorific <b>Mahātmā</b> (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in <b>South Africa</b> in 1914, is now used throughout the world.</p>
    <P>Born and raised in a <b>Hindu</b> family in coastal <b>Gujarat</b>, Gandhi trained in the law at the <b>Inner Temple, London</b>, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.</P>
    <p>Gandhi's birthday, <b>2 October</b>, is commemorated in India as <b>Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday</b>, and worldwide as the <b>International Day of Nonviolence</b>. Gandhi is considered to be the <b>Father of the Nation</b> in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called <b>Bapu</b> (Gujarati endearment for "father", roughly "papa",[2] "daddy"[3]).</p>
    <p>Gandhi's <b>father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi</b> (1822–1885), served as the <b>dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state</b>.[4][5] His family originated from the then village of <b>Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State</b>.[6] Although he only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[7]</p>
    <p>In May <b>1883</b>, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old <b>Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia</b> (her first name was usually shortened to <b>"Kasturba"</b>, and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.[29] In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.[30] His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.[31]</p>
